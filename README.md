# Houseplant-Yourself

##Description
Welcome! "Houseplant Yourself" is an app made with JavaScript and HTML/CSS. It allows users to select their zodiac sign and a random number to receive a recommended houseplant. If the user does not know their sign, they can input their birthday for the app to return the astrological sign so that they can progress to get their recommendation. The reccommedation result page displays name of houseplant, a photo, and a brief description of plant. This app was created as my Create Performance Task submission for the 2020 AP Computer Science Principles Exam, in which I received a 5, the highest score possible. Coding was done through Code.org's App Lab.
